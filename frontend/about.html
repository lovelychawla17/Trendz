      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Trendz was created as a college web development project, born from a shared interest in fashion, design, and digital creativity. What started as a simple idea turned into a fully functional website that reflects the vibrant energy of Gen Z style. We set out to design more than just a basic online store — we wanted to build a space that feels fresh, modern, and expressive.

        Throughout the project, we explored various aspects of front-end development — crafting clean layouts with HTML and CSS, adding interactivity with JavaScript, and making the site responsive for all devices. Each section, from the hero banner to the product cards, was designed with intention and attention to detail. While Trendz may not sell real products, it represents real effort, creativity, and learning.

        This project challenged us to think like designers and developers. We learned to balance visual appeal with functionality, and aesthetics with accessibility. Trendz is more than just a class assignment — it’s a small but meaningful showcase of what’s possible when code meets creativity.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission with Trendz is to bridge the gap between style and technology by building a digital space that reflects individuality, simplicity, and modern design. We aim to create an engaging user experience that not only looks good but works smoothly across all devices.

      Through this project, we also hope to demonstrate how powerful front-end development can be in telling a story and connecting with users. Every button, image, and section was created to mirror the feel of a real fashion brand — bold, vibrant, and expressive.

      Trendz stands for the spirit of learning and experimentation. Our mission is not just to build a website, but to grow our understanding of how design, development, and user experience come together to shape the future of digital commerce.
